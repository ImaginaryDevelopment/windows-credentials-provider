1. Plugin-style loading/unloading - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/unloadability
2. Cpu monitoring
3. the reloading of the dll may be annoying with ring X not shutting down/restarting always  ( app domain aware singleton)
4. the form is tied to the qr and api - accept delegate?
5. com register toggle(and manifest) is annoying for local vs running in a vm differences

7. see if we can enumerate cameras
8. add a blurb about local development having register for com interop off, and app manifest deleted
9. document Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{298D9F84-9BC5-435C-9FC2-EB3746625954}\InprocServer32 (adds CodeBase REG_SZ: example value file:///Z:/WindowsCredentialProviderTest/bin/Debug/WindowsCredentialProviderTest.dll)
